/// Infinite stream like `repeat_with()` are often used with adapters like

/// it is OK to keep the source element in memory, you should instead use
/// the [`stream.repeat()`] function.

/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::stream::{self, StreamExt};
///
/// // let's assume we have some value of a type that is not `Clone`
/// // or which don't want to have in memory just yet because it is expensive:
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
/// struct Expensive;
///
/// // a particular value forever:
/// let mut things = stream::repeat_with(|| Expensive);
///
/// assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next().await);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next().await);
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// Using mutation and going finite:
///
/// ```rust
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::stream::{self, StreamExt};
///
/// // From the zeroth to the third power of two:
/// let mut curr = 1;
